The year 2016 marked the twenty year anniversary of publication of Gail Hawisher, Cynthia Selfe, Paul LeBlanc, and Charles Moran’s Computers and 
the Teaching of Writing in American Higher Education 1979-1994: A History (hereafter referred to as The History Book). 
Since that time it has become a "go-to" text for anyone interested in understanding the  “sub-field” of writing studies known as computers and writing. 
It has been more than two decades since the book leaves off in its "Looking Forward" chapter (which covers the years 1992–1994), 
and we are proposing a follow-up eBook that does the same kind of historical tracing and archiving for 1995–2015 that The History Book did twenty years ago. 
This project will be a historical revival and a re-interrogation of a (sub)field that is more than four decades old. At the close of The History Book, 
the authors speculated about the future of the (sub)field. Though they  knew that it was taking hold, they could not foresee where it was going to go. 
Now we have twenty years of that “future” to recap, to learn from, and to reflect upon.
</p>

<p>
This eBook, <i>Are We There Yet?</i> will both trace the intervening history between when The History Book ends and the current status of computers and writing. 
We will address research questions that teacher-scholars of the (sub)field seem to return to again and again:  
1) What is and how do we define writing?, 2) What do we mean by and how do we define computer in computers and writing? 
In what ways have the technologies we used and studied changed?, 3) In what ways do we define the (sub)field and its relationship with the digital 
humanities and other disciplines?, 4) To what extent has computers and writing achieved its goals? Are we “there” yet?  To what extent has computers 
and writing cohered as its own autonomous (sub)field? What is the (sub)field’s relationship to writing studies more broadly?
</p>

<p>
At a 2016 Computers and Writing Conference Town Hall, Cynthia Selfe held up a copy of Computers and the Teaching of Writing in 
American Higher Education 1979-1994: A History and pointed out that computers and writing has not had an historical account of 
its work since that 1996 publication.  It is time, and there is a need, she said.  It is this gap in the scholarship of the (sub)field that
 this eBook will fill. It will do so in a way that is unprecedented. While the original history book begged to be a multimedia text 
 (complete with sidebars on the pages and bolded words that should have been hyperlinks), this text will be born digital,;yet it will 
 also honor an important goal of computers and writing: to keep the human element central to the work about and with 
 technology being done in the (sub)field. By including interview footage, complete with personal narratives about the interviewee’s 
 entrance to the community, this proposed eBook will make central the human agent  in a manner unique to and also reflective of 
 the scholarship of the discipline.
