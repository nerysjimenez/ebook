<h3>Our Lives</h3>

<p>

Just as Hawisher et al. (1996) recognized that their history cannot help but be filtered through their eyes, 
we realize that our own subject positions inevitably shape the story we tell, as well as what we choose to leave out or do not know to include.  
Indeed, what Hawisher et al. (1996) wrote of themselves continues to ring true for us: "we remain four situated individuals who have
read ourselves into the lives and works of people whose histories are told here" (p. 10). 
Moreover, we likewise recognize this relationship as reciprocal: "even as we write history, history is writing us" (Hawisher et al., 1996, p. 218). 
As such, we, as the authors of this eBook, have our own histories with writing and technology that inevitably shape the history we construct here.
There are undoubtedly important texts that we do not reference in this project. We hope others will discuss them in their own histories.

</p>
<h3>The Stakes</h3>
<p>
Hawisher et al. (1996) told us that the radical impact computers (will) have on the values of democratic education requires us 
to "pause and take the time to write a history (or rather, a collection of histories) of where the field has been" (p. 7). 
In many ways, this eBook acts as a response to that call. Now, as we compose this eBook, when computers and related digital 
technologies are often taken for granted as integral to writing processes, it is especially  important to keep in view the 
ideological situatedness of these tools. 
</p>

<p>
In some sense, it seems that the (sub)field of computers and writing has not changed radically over the twenty ensuing years in 
terms of its philosophy.  In 1996, Hawisher et al. described the "agenda" of computers and writing: "to develop an understanding 
of how computers can contribute to a better, more just and equitable writing classroom and thereby a better and more just educational 
system and society" (p. 2), an idea consistent with the field's explicit feminist orientation.

</center>

<br>
<p>

This feminist framework and resultant desire for egalitarianism has persisted. 
For instance, in 2001, Janice R. Walker pointed to this goal (through critiquing it) in her essay 
"Resisting Resistance: Power and Control in the Technologized Classroom": 
"The computer classroom has often been hailed as . . . a social-democratic space, helping to promote a liberatory pedagogy 
by fostering student resistance, empowering students by decentering the classroom" (p. 119). 
In his review of the first 20 years of <i>Computers and Composition</i> for the journal's 20th anniversary special issue in 2003, 
Charles Moran highlighted the prevalence of this focus, locating it in the historical moment of "our profession's reaction to 
the policies of the Reagan-Bush years": "the 1996-1997 issues seem a kind of watershed; before these issues, hopes for improved 
writing and the teaching of writing through technology predominated; after these volumes, we increasingly saw the computer as potentially, or 
inherently, supportive of critical pedagogy and, through this pedagogy, of a new and more just society" (p. 352). 
A year later, in his 2004 introduction to <i>Computers and Writing: The Cyborg Era</i>, James Inman described the pedagogy of 
computers and writing specifically as one that "promote[s] equity and diversity" (p. 1). We argue that these assessments 
and goal statements continue to characterize the (sub)field today, even if it has not always foregrounded a critical pedagogy 
approach to instruction and even as it has recognized the challenges to and critiqued these goals.

</center>

<br>
<p>
In addition to embracing this overt goal of using computer technologies to improve the teaching of writing and 
achieve democratic ends, teacher-scholars in computers and writing have long been interested in ideological readings 
and critiques of technology.  The (sub)field has sought an understanding of "how thoroughly ideology shapes many of 
the technological decisions that educators make; how it infuses processes of technology design, marketing and use; 
and how it contributes to an underlying stability to educational environments within which technology is employed" (Hawisher et al., 1996, p. 9). 
This critical understanding of technology, along with the commitment to a socially just, democratic, and decentered writing classroom, 
continue to be among the central tenets of the (sub)field.
</p>

<p>
The questions that Hawisher et al. (1996) pose in the "Coming of Age" section of <i>The History Book</i> regarding the limits to the potential 
for "positive educational change" as supported by computers are still relevant to the scholarship we cover in this history:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Was change limited to those classrooms or teachers that already supported a critical or reformist vision of education?</li>
<li>To what extent was the radical potential of technology ultimately constrained within existing social structures and ideological formations?</li>
<li>Was it possibleâ€¦that technology could provide the basis for fundamental and far-reaching social reform?  (pp. 210-211) </li>
</ul>

<p>
Much of what was at stake then rings true as of the time of this writing. 
There is a strong need for scholars and teachers of writing to address the laws, policies, and procedures that governments, 
corporations, universities, and other vested stakeholders write and execute that govern our professional and personal online 
(and offline) lives. This need becomes the fuel for our community to address the ideological freight of our digital spaces, 
a trend we found in the scholarship discussed in <i>The History Book</i>. The stories over the past twenty years have revealed that 
our educational, financial, legal, medical, professional, and social lives are at stake when we do not investigate the complex 
ecological network governing our mediated lives.
