<h3>A Note on the eBook's Structure</h3>

<p>
This eBook is designed to enhance aspects of <i>The History Book</i> through digitization.  
For example, hyperlinks and hyperlinked footnotes replace material that would have been found in the "sidebar" marginalia of <i>The History Book</i>.  
Navigational options, including drop down menus, can be used used to explore the book chapters in both linear and nonlinear ways.
The supplemental and supportive interview material in its various forms is interspersed throughout the book, embedded within the text portions; 
instead of at the end of chapters, as they appear in <i>The History Book</i>. A transcript of the Twitter conversation appears much like 
the MOO transcript did in the closing pages of <i>The History Book</i>.  
</p>

<p>

While <i>The History Book</i> was organized in chronological order by chapter-that is, each chapter covered approximately a 
three year period-we decided to structure each of our chapters around a research question governed by a theme. 
Within the individual chapters, we lay out a loose chronology of trends and emerging concepts during the twenty year period 
we are studying, while making note of significant shifts and pointing out enduring tendencies. 
We decided to organize the eBook chapters around research questions rather than time periods based largely on 
the volume and pace of technological advancements during 1995-2015. It is important to remember that <i>The History Book</i> covered "only" 
fifteen years of slower change and growth in the (sub)field. It is also important to note that Hawisher et. al. (1996)
also struggled with this chronological organization. While they defended their choice, as we do ours, they also acknowledged facing "a number of major problems"
related to the pace of change, as well as to creating the tacit (and faulty) idea that "the field is a static, fixed entity moving through time" (pp. 12-13). 
Moreover, the authors pointed out that history is an ongoing process, happening as we attempt to record it (p. 14). 
With the organizational structure of our eBook, we point to patterns as they emerge, repeat, and disappear in the scholarship of this (sub)field. 
In order to provide commentary in a (at times) nonlinear fashion, we needed a less constraining format than covering only a 
limited time period within a chapter. Because our individual chapters work internally in chronological order, we were not able to 
apply the helpful organizing framework provided in each chapter of <i>The History Book</i>: "Considering Contexts," "Observing Trends," and "Recognizing Challenges"; 
however, we do our best to comment on each of these considerations within the analysis provided in each chapter. 
At times we do diverge from our chronology within individual chapters. We do so when describing emerging concepts, 
topics, and ideas that have continued importance in the (sub)field across a large span of years. 
Typically, when we complete the discussion and analysis of the topic, we pick up the chronology where we left off.      
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><b>Chapter one </b> explores the question of how we as (sub)field have defined and redefined what we mean by "writing" over the past twenty years. 
In particular, the chapter addresses the shift to multimodality from computers and writing's early focus on alphabetic text. 
Whereas early MUDS and MOOS captured movement (*waves goodbye, for example), setting, and emotion in the form of print text, 
today's online interactions and communication involve multiple forms of media and modes-combining images , audio, video, and 
print text-removing the need to recreate "real life" experience through the written word.  Texts like Jason Palmeri's <i>Remixing Composition</i> (2012), 
of course, remind us that rhetoric has always taken medium into consideration. Ted Nellen shares a similar perspective in 
"Re: The future of computers and writing: A multivocal textumentary": 
</p>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>
[C]omposition got sidetracked from the original forms of communication-orality, drama, and visual arts-to focus just on the alphabet and textâ€¦.  
Our word writing connotes letters and words, whereas the Greeks and Romans had gram and graph, which roughly translate into writing and drawing; 
these terms were interchangeable for the Greeks, but not for us.... That we have restricted composition and rhetoric to the alphabet and to words is too bad, 
and has limited us and but today's first year writing classroom now has to grapple with teaching this aspect of the rhetorical situation in ways we haven't 
in the past (Hart-Davidson & Krause, 2004, pp. 155-156)
</BLOCKQUOTE></p> 

<p>
While keeping in mind the fact that multimodal composing practices are not entirely new to our field, the chapter describes this new dimension of 
teaching (first-year writing and beyond) and composing that Nellen references.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Chapter two</b> addresses the following questions: What do we mean by and how do we define the "computers" part of computers and writing?
 In what ways have the technologies we commonly use and study in the (sub)field changed? <i>The History Book</i> ended by proclaiming 
 the soon-to-be normalcy of word processing as part of the writing process. In the ensuing years, computing has become ubiquitous, 
 creating educational opportunities that extend far beyond the classroom, reach many more students, and are often networked and online.
 We have shifted from alphabetic texts written on computers in labs using word processing software to more social, multimedia, and multimodal 
 forms of composing as described in the introduction and in chapter one. This chapter discusses the rise of Online Writing Instruction (OWI) 
 and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), as well as other forms of educational technology now commonly used in the writing classroom, 
 including blogs, remix videos, photo essays, Twitter, Wikipedia, and so on. In addition, this chapter will also address mobile education, 
 as we have moved away from computer labs as the primary space within which computers and writing was enacted to ubiquitous and cloud c
 omputing spaces where composing can happen everywhere and anywhere. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chapter three </b> examines the rise of the digital humanities and its relationship to writing studies. 
Despite computers and writing's longstanding history of actually "doing" digital humanities work, this area of scholarship 
has more recently been subsumed and claimed by literary studies. This chapter looks at the ways we define the (sub)field and its 
relationship with/to the digital humanities and suggests ways we might work to grow and improve upon this relationship.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chapter four </b>takes stock of the current status of the relationship between computers and writing and writing studies and maps out 
where we are now as a (sub)field, as well as provides ideas for new directions for research and teaching.  
This chapter engages the following questions: To what extent has computers and writing achieved the goals and "agenda" outlined in 
The <i>History Book</i>?, To what extent has computers and writing cohered as its own autonomous (sub)field? What is the (sub)field's relationship 
to writing studies more broadly?
