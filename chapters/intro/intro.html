<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> <BLOCKQUOTE>
This is a history composed of histories. 
It has a particular focus: the way in which computers entered and changed the field of composition studies, 
a field that defines itself both as a research community and as a community of teachers. 
(Hawisher et al., 1996, p. 1) </BLOCKQUOTE></p>

<p>
This eBook celebrates the landmark text 
<i>Computers and the Teaching of Writing in American Higher Education 1979-1994: A History (hereafter referred to as The History Book)</i>, collaboratively authored by Gail E. Hawisher, Paul LeBlanc, Charles Moran, and Cynthia L. Selfe (1996). One would be hard pressed to find a more comprehensive history of “the way in which computers entered and changed the field of composition studies” (p. 1). Published in 1996, the book provided a history of how computers “entered and changed” writing studies while also documenting “how people in the field used computers.” Above all, it chronicled the growth of the computers and writing “community” and described how teacher-scholars affected change with (and through) technology (p. 2).  Their history, in other words, was people-driven rather than technology-driven.

<p>
Our eBook, <i>Are We There Yet?</i>, continues the story and history of people in computers and writing from 1995 to 2015. 
Just as Hawisher et al. (1996) recognized that there are many separate histories within the story they seek to tell, so do we. 
There is no one “correct” history and we do not endeavor to provide that here. 
Rather, we follow in the footsteps of Hawisher et al. in describing how scholars, teachers, graduate students, 
and administrators have continued to define (as well as debate) the field of computers and writing as an important site of research, 
technology, and pedagogy. The focus on people is purposeful. 
Computers and writing has a long history dedicated to interrogating and understanding the myriad ways that people integrate technology 
into their everyday, professional, and civic lives. 
This eBook, then, serves as both a celebration of the <i>History Book</i> and a continuation story 
by providing follow-up analysis of how the (sub)field of computers and writing has witnessed, discussed, 
and grappled with rapid developments in computing technologies and its position in relation to the larger fields of writing studies and English studies. 
</p>

<p>
The final chapter of the <i>History Book</i> left off in 1994—a year after the “Year of the Internet” (p. 229)—
a pivotal moment of rapid and unprecedented technological changes not seen since the age of Gutenberg. 
By 1994, computers were slowly becoming more common in educational settings, yet it is clear that Hawisher et al. 
(1996) had difficulty predicting how the Internet would affect the teaching of writing in the future. 
Hawisher et al. do agree, however, that “most people came to expect that the National Information 
infrastructure would make it possible to access vast amounts of information, in all media, in homes, schools, and businesses” (p. 232).  
This, as we now know with the benefit of hindsight, is an understatement to say the least.  
The Internet in later iterations (what has come to be known as the “read/write web” or Web 2.0, or even Web 3.0;see McClure, 2010) 
has done far more than simply provide access to information on a large scale; it has fundamentally reshaped 
the ways in which we write, communicate, create, learn, think, and live. Indeed, it has drastically altered our personal, professional, and civic lives.
<p>

<p>
Thus, the post-1994 period is ripe for discussion in computers and writing circles. 
The Digital Age has brought with it not only seismic changes to our habits, our beliefs, and our lives, 
but also changes to how we think about knowledge, information, learning, participation, and most importantly, 
for our purposes, what it means to write and how we conceptualize the teaching of writing now in the 21st century. 
Whether it is through increased access to knowledge via powerful search engines or sharing videos through an app on a smartphone, 
technology brings people to a critical nexus of information exchange. Just as Hawisher et al. (1996) 
believed technology was/is an agent for writing and communicating, we too believe technology is 
a non-human agent with abilities to influence, direct, control, and benefit lives in and out of our profession. 
This dual focus on both the agentive aspect of technology and the users of technology remains central to the field 
of computers and writing—and central to our project here.
</p>

<p>
In addition to an attempt to chronicle the impacts of post-1994 technological change, 
this eBook also seeks to codify the history of the people working in computers and writing. 
Through including segments of audio (phone), video, and print (email correspondence) interviews, 
this eBook includes the stories of people who have defined, continue to define, and will define this discipline.
These interviews include the original four authors of <i>The History Book</i> (Hawisher, LeBlanc, Moran, & Selfe), 
as well as other teacher-scholars featured in <i>The History Book</i>, such as Lisa Gerrard and Michael Day. 
Beyond those early trailblazers of the (sub)field, we wanted to gain the perspective of more recent teacher-scholars 
whom we identified as actively involved in the community: those recently published, regular conference attendees, 
and editors of journals. Additionally, the six scholars (Eric Crump, Michael Day, Joyce Locke Carter, Johndan Johnson-Eilola, 
Rebecca Rickly, & Pamela Takayoshi) involved in <i>The History Book</i>’s closing MOO reconvened for a “twittersation” 
to discuss the ways in which field has changed. This move from the text-based interactive MOO to Twitter is more 
than just a nod to the earlier text, however. It is representative of the kinds of technological changes that have transpired over the past twenty years. 
Students and teachers initially used computers in the classroom as word processors and for text-based social interaction in the form of MOOs, 
but such use has evolved through the years. Computers in the classroom are now used for and as instructional tools,
including Course and Learning Management Systems (CMS and LMS), Social Networking Sites (SNS), and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)—
all of which are networked, interactive, and multimodal. 
</p>

<p>
Throughout its history, one of the hallmark traits of computers and writing has been the willingness of members of its community to welcome, 
embrace, and share new ideas, technologies, and people to its conferences, journals, and social media channels. We operate from that same framework here.
