<h3>Computers and Writing: A Separate Field or Subfield?</h3>

One of the central questions underpinning <i>The History Book</i> is whether computers and writing is a separate field or 
subfield from the larger field of writing studies. This question remains central in our book as well. Ours is certainly 
not the first text to reflect on the (sub)field of computers and writing and its relationship to the field of writing studies as a whole. 
In 2004 a group of teacher-scholars in the field composed a "multivocal" article published in <i>Computers and Composition</i>. Together these scholars predicted that
<BLOCKQUOTE> [i]n the near future, the field/interest/sub-discipline of computers and writing will cease to be 
different from the field/interest/larger discipline composition and rhetoric because all composition 
specialists shall be expected to understand the importance of using computers and other technologies to teach writing. 
(Hart-Davidson & Krause, 2004, p. 147) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Some of them claimed , the entire field of writing studies would be about computers and writing 
(as a research area) rather than a separate branch of the larger field as computers and emergent 
technologies became more ubiquitous. Certainly, as the interviews we share in this eBook show, 
advancements in computing technologies have indeed opened new directions for writing studies as a field and led 
writing studies to incorporate into its mainstream publications discussions about technologies' impact upon writing.  
As the title of our eBook, <i>Are We There Yet?</i>, suggests, however, whether writing studies has become synonymous with computers 
and writing is arguable. Several years after Hart-Davidson et al.'s 2004 prognostication, in 2011, Janice R. Walker et al. 
wrote "<i>Computers and Composition</i> 20/20: A Conversation Piece, or What Some Very Smart People Have to Say about the Future" in 
<i>Computers and Composition</i> as an extension of the "Town Hall" style conversation held each year at the Computers and Writing conference. 
For this article, the contributors offered predictions about what writing will be, where it will exist, 
and what it will do (a question we likewise engage in the next chapter). A common thread among participants was 
acknowledgement of the importance of educating students about the multiple facets of digital literacy. 
If anything, the larger field of writing studies has picked up this trend because of the impact digital age technologies 
have upon professional and personal lives. Our eBook continues these ongoing conversations and debates about the uses of 
computers for  writing, the promise and challenges of digital literacy, and the (sub)field's impact on the larger field of writing studies. 
</p>

Ultimately, this eBook traces the intervening history between when <i>The History Book</i> ends and the status of computers and writing as of 2015. 
In doing so, the eBook continues to grapple with the debate over the relationship between computers and writing and writing studies as a field. 
As evidenced by the increased presence of scholarship on digital technologies in CCCCs presentations and in NCTE journals, the two now 
arguably overlap in more significant ways. Additionally, the substantial growth of the annual Computers and Writing Conference reflects a 
continued interest in maintaining a distinct "field/interest/sub-discipline" from the larger discipline of writing studies.
Indeed, as our interviews illustrate, some teacher-scholars in computers and writing are almost militant about protecting a 
distinct status while others believe the distinction may no longer be necessary, if it exists at all. Our eBook tries to capture 
this continuum of perspectives through interviews with many teacher-scholars in computers and writing in our attempt to document both 
where we were and are now as a field.
