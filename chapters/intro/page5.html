<h3>Our Sources, Our Histories</h3>
<p>
To narrow the scope of our project, we settled on five primary sites of research: <i>Computers and Composition</i>, 
<i>Computers and Composition Online </i> , Kairos, programs from the Computers and Writing Conference, and books 
(including monographs and edited collections in print and online). We selected <i>Computers and Composition</i>, 
<i>Computers and Composition Online </i>, and Kairos  because they are the three peer-reviewed journals most directly 
relevant to computers and writing and they each have established histories of influence in the (sub)field. Certainly, 
computers and writing scholars have published important work in other journals, including the flagship NCTE journals of 
writing studies, <i>College English</i> and <i>College Composition and Communication</i>, and we occasionally still reference these texts
 when relevant to answering the research questions governing each chapter. However, focusing our research archive allowed us to 1) 
 direct our reading efforts, 2) concentrate on significant voices in computers and writing, 3) create a manageable corpus, and 
 4) more readily track trends in scholarship. . We hope readers will understand the need to put parameters around our objects of analyses. 
</p>

<p>
Our goal was to discern notable movements, concepts, and themes-particularly those that addressed and/or added a new dimension 
to our research questions.  Therefore, we further narrowed our research corpus by attending to  citation counts and keywords 
in particular time periods. We divided the research into ten year spans (1995-2004, 2005-2015) for each of the authors, and 
then we focused our reading and analysis on peer-reviewed articles and books with certain citation counts (though each author 
also wrote about texts in the other author's period, as well as texts outside the designated citation count that addressed the 
research questions). As Colleen A. Reilly and Douglas Eyman (2007) point out in their essay "Multifaceted Methods for Multimodal Texts," 
journals in computers and writing "may be underrepresented in the standard citation databases"-especially online journals-due to their "low impact rating" (p. 357). 
Thus, the benchmark for the numbers of citations that we selected depended on several factors, including medium (digital or print or both; e.g., 
we found that print publications had higher citation counts so for digital publications we had to lower the threshold for the number of 
citations that constituted a significant work) and year of publication (more recent publications have fewer citations, so we likewise had 
to lower the threshold for these publications). We collected data using two tools: Google Scholar and Voyant Tools. Collecting citation counts 
from Google Scholar for all articles and webtexts published in <i>Kairos</i> and <i>Computers and Composition</i> during the years 1995-2015 gave us a loose 
indication of which key works and landmark texts to study most closely. We selected Google Scholar because we could access it easily and it is 
commonly used and held in high repute in academia. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to relying on citation counts to help us narrow our corpus, we also attended to article keywords. 
Articles in <i>Computers and Composition</i>, as well as <i>Kairos</i>, in some cases, provide keywords. 
We selected Voyant Tools because it helped us determine the keywords for texts that did not already provide them. 
Attending to text keywords allowed us to  include in our objects of analysis texts topically relevant to our research questions. 
That is, we also referenced texts with pertinent keywords, even if they did not have high citation counts.

<i>Terminology of the (Sub)field</i></p>
<p> 
Part of the process of reflecting on our (sub)field's history since <i>The History Book</i> entailed selecting which terms to use in our eBook. 
We chose <i>writing studies</i> to designate the larger discipline also known as rhetoric and composition or composition studies in order 
to reflect our sense of the term most widely accepted as of the time of this writing and to capture the full range of work done by teacher-scholars. 
That is, following Susan Miller (2002), we selected <i>writing studies</i> as a term that is capacious, that accounts for the multiple forms and 
types of texts we create, study, and teach. Certainly, as with all the terms we selected, arguments can be made for other selections.
</p>

<p>
We decided to use the term <i>computers and writing</i> for our (sub)field given its prevalence and its use to designate the flagship 
conference for teacher-scholars who self-identify in this area.  We also wanted to distinguish references to the discipline 
from references to its flagship journal, <i>Computers and Composition</i>.
</p>

<p>
Concomitantly, we needed to decide what term to use to capture the status of computers and writing. 
To reference computers and writing, we chose the term <i>(sub)field</i> to reflect the conversation, 
which we address earlier in this chapter and elsewhere in the eBook, surrounding whether computers 
and writing is a subfield of writing studies, has been absorbed into or is now indistinguishable from 
writing studies, or is its own distinct field. Our research and interviews suggest this is an unsettled question, 
so we selected a term that reflects this debate.
</p>

<p>
To reflect another unsettled debate in the <i>(sub)field</i>, we use the terms <i>writing</i> and <i>composing</i> interchangeably. 
We recognize some members of the (sub)field have strong preferences for one term over the other, 
often associated with whether they see the term <i>composing</i> as referencing a broader range of activities 
(e.g., video production, podcasts, graphics, etc.) and whether they believe the (sub)field should attend to these practices.

</center>

<br>
<p>
We also needed to make seemingly small but, for our (sub)field, significant choices regarding the use and capitalization of particular terms. 
For instance, we reference this project as an eBook to use a known term that highlights the bookâ€™s digital nature (the term dBook, or digital book, 
has not yet been adopted!). With apologies to Janice R. Walker and Todd Taylor (2006), we lowercase the terms internet and <i>web</i> to reflect recent 
trends in this direction. For instance, as of June 1 2016, the <i>Associated Press Stylebook</i> stipulated that <i>internet</i> and <i>web</i> should be lowercased. 
Other prominent online publications, including <i>Buzzfeed</i>, <i>Wired</i>, and <i>Vox</i>, likewise lowercase <i>internet</i> (Martin, 2016). 
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization_of_%22Internet%22">Wikipedia article on the subject</a> ("Capitalization," 2017), also indicates that the lowercase spelling of <i>internet</i> is more and more commonly used. 
We note, though, that APA, MLA, and Chicago styles, as well as the Oxford Dictionaries, all continue to capitalize <i>internet</i> and <i>web</i>, as far as we know. 
Still, we believe that lowercased use is just a matter of time and we want our eBook to read as looking toward the future. Additionally, 
we reference <i>technologies</i> in the plural to emphasize the multiple, varied machines, hardware, software, and programs that we use for our teaching, 
research, and service. Finally, we use the term <i>teacher-scholar</i> to refer to members of the (sub)field in order to acknowledges the dual roles of 
practitioners in the (sub)field. Hawisher et al. (1996) also use this term in <i>The History Book</i>.
