<h3>The Past Twenty Years</h3>


<p>
Twenty years later many aspects of higher education remain unchanged. 
For instance, despite the growth of online classes, most colleges and universities have not abandoned 
the "brick and mortar" computer classroom altogether, nor have we abandoned alphabetic/print writing as 
the central object of study in the field of writing studies or as the central form of production in writing classes, 
despite some early predictions otherwise (e.g., Anson, 1999; Bolter, 2001). If the philosophical and theoretical leanings 
of the field have not changed much in the twenty years since <i>The History Book</i> was published, certainly the story of 
"how people in the field used [...] computers" has shifted. Technological platforms, innovations, and their pedagogical 
implementation have changed remarkably since the close of the book in 1994. In his 1992 chapter from 
<i>Re-Imagining Computers and Composition</i>, Charles Moran predicted that "the writing classroom of the next millennium 
will be radically different from the writing classroom of today" (p. 10). Here Moran is prescient, though perhaps the 
classroom is not as radically different as Moran predicted.

</center>

What has changed significantly, however, in the twenty years since Hawisher et al. (1996) published their text is that the sites, 
spaces, and potentialities for writing in all forms have expanded in ways that could not have been predicted. For example, 
online course options have grown tremendously from their first appearance in the mid-eighties. And while many writing courses
 continue to be taught in computer labs, cloud computing, laptops, and mobile devices mean that neither student nor instructor need 
 to remain tethered to the space of the physical computer lab on campus (as long as they have access to robust wireless networks or 
 internet connectivity). In addition, mobile devices are ubiquitous and often do not require keyboards. Though many teachers may lament 
 the presence of cell phones in classrooms, students today rely on them to access readings, look up concepts discussed in class (Parry, 2011), 
 write papers (Grabill et al., 2010), do research, live tweet, communicate with their instructors, watch videos (Pflugfelder, 2015), and so on. 
 In fact, one of the most exciting developments of the past twenty years is how much writing-and writing that is deeply social and 
 highly collaborative-takes place beyond the computer lab in online spaces likes blogs, wikis, Twitter, and Google Docs (see Yancey, 2004). 
 Moreover, both the production and consumption of digital texts in writing classrooms has become not only more common, but regularly expected, 
 as is illustrated by Council of Writing Program Administrators, National Council of Teachers of English, and National Writing Project's (2011) 
 <a href="http://www.ncte.org/positions/statements/collwritingframework">Framework For Success in Postsecondary Writing</a> and NCTE's <a href="http://www.ncte.org/positions/statements/21stcentdefinition">Definition of 21st Century Literacies</a> (2013). When it comes to the professional 
 parameters of our field, early computers and writing teacher-scholars debated whether or not software development could count for tenure 
 (Lang, Walker, & Dorwick, 2000), but in the past fifteen years teacher-scholars have considered how we might need to rethink tenure requirements
 altogether in the age of digital composing and scholarship (Ball & Moeller, 2008; Purdy & Walker, 2012; Purdy & Walker, 2010).

Another significant change since the publication of <i>The History Book</i> is that computers are now an ubiquitous 
mainstream writing tool. As Lisa Gerrard (1995) writes, "In the early 1980s, many of our colleagues . . . thought we were exaggerating 
when we claimed that computers improved students' attitudes toward composition, made it easy for them to revise, and led them to 
approach writing as a process. How modest those claims seem now" (p. 286). Rather than asking whether computers are valuable for 
the writing process (which is now taken mostly as a given), the story of how people use, as well as subvert, computers and digital 
media has become increasingly important as technology shapes the pedagogical and theoretical work of this (sub)field. Perhaps as a result, 
the earlier perspective that scholars involved in computers and writing were outliers or "oddities" (Gerrard, 1995, p. 280) 
had begun to wane even by 1995. As Gerrard notes, "[C]omputer studies is no longer on the lunatic fringe of English studies. 
We may not be mainstream, but we're not clinging to the margins anymore, either" (p. 289). Indeed, this is also a sentiment shared
by many of the teacher-scholars we interviewed.

</center>

<br>
<p>
In addition to (or perhaps as part of) moving from the margins, the (sub)field has become more "social." 
The "social turn" in the field of writing studies is by now a familiar part of our shared history, but 
our work on this eBook suggests that we are now in the midst of yet another "social turn" brought about 
by the rise of digital technologies. While the original "social turn" described an expanded understanding of the social 
construction of knowledge, writers, and texts, in this second social turn we see that the "turn" digital technologies have taken is "social," 
namely, interactional and participatory. Douglas Eyman laid the groundwork for this digital "social turn" in composition theory in his 1996 Kairos 
webtext, "Hypertext in the Computer-Facilitated Writing Class": "Computer mediated communication technologies afford the classroom 
instructor the medium through which a social-epistemic rhetoric can be enacted in the classroom, serving as both a focal point 
for the building of community and a method of collaboration."  This is also evident in the use of the term <i>Web 2.0</i> to describe the read/write web.  
With <i>Web 2.0</i>, no longer were we passive consumers of the material the web had to offer, but we could become active participants in and composers of 
the texts that comprise the web.
