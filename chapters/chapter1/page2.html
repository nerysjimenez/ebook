An example of our (sub)field's long-term involvement in rethinking and redefining writing is seen in Pamela Takayoshi's 1996 article 
"The Shape of Electronic Writing: Evaluating and Assessing Computer-Assisted Writing Processes and Products," which quoted from John Ruszkiewicz's 1988 
article, "Word and Image: The Next Revolution." Ruszkiewicz described a future for writing instruction when the term <i>writing</i> 
became "inadequate to describe what we do in the future when we sit down to compose" (p.10). 
Takayoshi focused on what she described as the erasure of the writing process--multiple drafts occurring in one computer-assisted document.  
</p>

<p>
Borrowing from Patricia Sullivan (1991), Takayoshi described electronic writing as a "seamless flow of prose" (p. 254). 
For her, given this "seamlessness," students needed to actively become conscious of the writing process as embedded within a document-in-progress. 
She suggested that students demarcated their process accordingly when it was no longer marked by distinct drafts because doing so 
could help them become "active literate individuals" (p. 256). 
By offering ways students could be mindful composers in the face of new technological innovations, 
Takayoshi highlighted the (sub)field's consistent emphasis on people over technologies.   

</p>

<p>
Takayoshi (1996) also addressed challenges posed to assessment created by electronic writing --in particular hypertext and the 
(re)emergence of visual rhetoric. Ultimately, her point was that utilizing print-based notions of response to 
and assessment of student work could overlook three key features of electronic writing: 
"fluidity of computer-assisted writing, visual rhetoric, and hypertexts" (p. 255). 
She predicted that assessments of the future would need to take page design into consideration, 
and teachers would need to think about how to respond to and assess visual rhetoric without 
"falling back into a current-traditional emphasis on surface features of text" (p. 250). 
She professed that the 8.5 x 11 paper with Times 12 pt. font would not be able to live on as the (only) correct version of an academic text.  
She further acknowledged that the possibility of creating hypertext in a computer-assisted writing classroom would present 
a challenge for traditional assessment: "Features of text meant to be read online, such as the organization of a text's 
elements and the ease with which the text allows readers to make logical links, will require assessment standards unneeded for traditional 
hard copy texts" (p. 253). Takayoshi (1996) was prescient. Over the twenty years since <i>The History Book</i>, scholarship in the (sub)field, 
including such work as Heidi McKee and Danielle Nicole DeVoss's (2013) <i>Digital Writing Assessment</i>, Meredith W. Zoetewey and Julie Staggers' (2003)
"Beyond Current-traditional Design: Assessing Rhetoric in New Media" (2003), Madeleine Sorapure's (2005) 
"Between Modes: Assessing Student New Media Compositions," and Yancey's (2004) "Made Not Only in Words,"  
has grappled with the issue of how best to assess multimodal texts.

</p>

<p>

Despite these forward thinking visions of what writing would become and how it could be assessed, during the 1990s, 
the "writing" in computers and writing most often still referred to a print-based act. 
The act of word-processing, along with the ability to cut and paste, brought new life and energy to the process-based 
models of writing that the larger field of writing studies had already been emphasizing. MOOs (Multi-user domain Object Oriented) 
effectively exemplified the continued prevalence of print even in online spaces. Popular as an experimental, but powerful, 
writing space in the mid-1990s, MOOs, according to Leslie D. Harris (1996), reinforced, 
"the joy of speaking/writing: contributing to a public discourse, achieving recognition through those contributions, 
and receiving the virtual equivalent of applause through the supportive feedback of others." 
Harris saw MOOsas having the potential to counteract some of the negative baggage students so often associated 
with writing because they could experience the satisfaction of immediate feedback to their ideas. 
Because of this possibility, she described MOOs as "incubators of powerful ideas" created through the act of text 
composition written both in front of and for others. Joel A. English furthered this idea in his 1998 <i>Kairos</i> article on metacognition
and MOOs in which he proposed that online writing conferences combine attributes of learning, such as  analysis and metacognition, 
in a way that had never been done before. Specifically, he reported using MOOs to perform peer and instructor writing conferences 
that left student writers with a log of the interaction from which they could continue to learn after the synchronous meeting was complete.
Face-to-face conferences and workshops provided no such transcript. Additionally, for English, the conversational nature of 
the synchronous writing environment provided immediately reflective writing on writing related issues-what 
English characterized as "reflection-on-action"-a unique affordance of the MOO:    

</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
The metacognition that takes place during computer-mediated conversation surpasses reflective writing and journaling
in that it is interactively instructive and exists in a controllable, multi-media environment; 
and it has an advantage over traditional writing conferences in that it exists in a text-based environment, 
stressing the importance of strategic, transactional writing. And finally, the transcripts that are created 
during the conversations provide interactive texts that are used for reflection indefinitely afterwards. 
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
In this way, English illustrated the (sub)field's concern with the use of new computer technologies to accomplish existing writing tasks.

</p>

<p>

One long-standing concern of the (sub)field can be described by the "old wine in new bottles" adage. 
That is, simply transporting a print-based composing practice to an electronic environment does not a new pedagogy make, 
nor does it mean that we need to automatically celebrate such an approach. This was an especially relevant concern during 
this period of print-based technologies. For example, computer-mediated communication (CMC) was a popular object of analysis 
for computers and writing teacher-scholars in the 1990s. CMC frequently involved asynchronous and synchronous forms of 
electronic communication such as discussion boards and listservs and was used with varied pedagogical approaches and with 
mixed results in the last half of the 1990s. Douglas Eyman (1996) described CMC as privileging the social-epistemic rhetoric 
proposed by Berlin (<u>1987</u>) by stimulating interactivity and encouraging a multiplicity of viewpoints. Sibylle Gruber (1995) 
studied its use in a graduate composition studies course, and her results provide a counter-balance to the then popular belief 
that computer-mediated discourse aids in creating a decentralized classroom with increased student participation.
Looking at her results through a Freirean lens, Gruber pointed to the strong potential for discord 
and tension to result when communication is conducted electronically; however, she concluded that if one uses CMC with an explicit, 
liberatory pedagogy, then "the increased tensions and anxieties do not necessarily translate into insurmountable problems" (p. 77). 
Gruber was one of the first to warn against letting the technology facilitate the learning, 
as opposed to developing a strong pedagogical approach supported by the technology (a caution that will be discussed further in chapter 2).  
A year later, Avigail Oren (1996) made a similar argument about MOOs in her <i>Kairos</i> article, "MOOing Is More than Writing." 
Oren pointed out that the pedagogical characteristics often attributed to MOOs--active learning, group communication, information literacy--are 
not "newborn from the technology's features." Attention to MOOs, however, waned as the 1990s progressed.   

</p>

<p>
Writing centers were among the first pedagogical spaces to also embrace the movement to electronic writing and online learning, 
particularly in the form of online writing labs, or OWLs. In 1995, <i>Computers and Composition</i> dedicated a special themed issues to OWLs, 
and the first issue of <i>Kairos</i> in 1996 had the same theme. In keeping with some of the previous scholarship 
that touted the potentially liberatory effects of online learning and computer-based writing, J. Paul Johnson (1996) 
argued for the subversive potential of OWLs, which he believed could call into question the "ideology of print" and 
also create "a writing space in which textual transactions renegotiate literate behavior." 
Early books on OWLs and networked writing centers, particularly Eric Hobson's (1998) <i>Wiring the Writing Center</i> 
and James A. Inman and Donna N. Sewell's Taking Flight with OWLs (2000), made similar arguments. 
Mike Palmquist charted the trajectory of this scholarship in his 2003 article for the 20th Anniversary special issue of <i>Computers and Composition</i>, 
"A Brief History of Computer Support for Writing Centers and Writing-across-the-Curriculum Programs," which we discuss further in Chapter 2.
</p>

<p>

In the mid-to-late 1990s, several key terms of writing studies were "remixed," so to speak, in order to account for the "electronic" realm. 
In order to describe the work of Online Writing Labs (OWLs), for instance, J. Paul Johnson (1996) used terms like "cybertutors" and "papertext." 
The latter referred to the more traditional notion of print-based student papers but  also intended to get at the ideological 
construct of writer and text as stable and cohesive. Pamela Takayoshi (1996) utilized the terms "electronic writing" and "computer-assisted" 
writing processes and composition instruction in, "The Shape of Electronic Writing: Evaluating and Assessing Computer-Assisted Writing Processes and Products." 
In this same article, she also described the emergence of "visual rhetoric." Rhetoric became "HyperRhetoric" 
in Gary Heba's 1997 <i>Computers and Composition</i> article.  Alan Rea and Doug White gave us a set of "hyperheuristics" in 1999.  
At the turn of the new millennium, Barry Maid, published and presented on aspects of gaining tenure for "technorhetoricians"--
a term attributable to Eric Crump (2000, p. 1). And James E. Porter introduced the term "internetworked writing" in his 1998 book, 
</i>Rhetorical Ethics and Internetworked Writing</i>. He defined "internetworked writing" as 
"computer-based electronic writing that makes synchronous or asynchronous links to remote participants or databases" (p. 2). 
This term is distinct from the better known term <i>networked writing</i>, and the more general concept of computer-mediated communication (CMC) 
"in that it involves writing for and on the internet," so it includes things like electronic groups, listservs, emails, and synchronous conferencing (p. 2). 
This term marks one of the first times that we see direct acknowledgement of the decidedly more social and public shift that writing has taken, 
along with an awareness of how this brings challenges to the writing classroom and its instructors. 

</p>

<p>
Beyond neologizing terms to help audiences see applications of concepts to electronic technologies, 
teacher-scholars in the (sub)field recognized a need to reconsider the notion of audience itself. 
In a somewhat prophetic take on audience, Robert R. Johnson's 1997 article "Audience Involved: Toward a Participatory Model of Writing" 
seized the moment of technological change to argue for a reformulation of audience, which historically had been either "invoked" or "addressed" 
in composition theory (Ede & Lunsford, 1984), to include the idea of "audience involved":  
"a refashioned model of writing that has implications for writing processes, notions of community, and even agency. . .  .  
Missing from most discussions of collaborative writing is audience as an actual living, breathing figure in the discourse production" (pp. 362-363). 
As a technical writer, Johnson's focus was on texts that the audience (end-user) actually uses, thereby making them involved. 
But it is easy to see the parallel here to the rapidly growing audience of internet readers who would eventually 
become participatory readers, helping to shape online discourse through feedback via comments sections, whiteboards, 
shared reading (through sites like diigo and Scribd), social media, and so on, as well as webtext and website creators themselves.
