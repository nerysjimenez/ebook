Questions involving the relationship between writing and technologies are not new nor unique to computers and writing. 
Scholars (Bolter, 1991; Haas, 1996, 1999; Baron, 1999; Havelock, 1977, 1982, 1988; Palmeri, 2012) have long reminded us that 
writing itself is a technology made possible through other technologies (e.g., clay tablet, codex, pencil, paper, computer, and so on). 
While we too view writing as a technology and acknowledge that the debates over technologies’ influence on writing (and vice versa) have
a long history dating back to ancient Greece, the scope of this project (and our (sub)field, for the most part) is more concerned with 
new(er) questions about the relationship between writing and <i>computer technologies</i> specifically. In particular, in this history we look 
at the ways in which writing has been defined and redefined as composing practices that involve online networked access and incorporate 
audio, video, and images. Indeed, this view of composing has become increasingly normalized since <i>The History Book</i> was written, at least 
within our (sub)field and even within our umbrella organizations NCTE and CCCC that now strongly recommend such a view in publications such 
as the <i>Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing</i> (CWPA, NCTE, & NWP, 2011) and the <i>NCTE Definition of 21st Century Literacies</i> (NCTE, 2013). 
So while we acknowledge that teacher-scholars have long seen composition as multimodal practices, in this eBook we focus on how our thinking 
about those practices has been revisited and revised over the past twenty years.

In her 1998 position statement from the Computers and Writing Conference town hall on the topic of "The Writing *in* Computers,"
Gail E. Hawisher made the point that "writing is headed into *more* of everything (alphabetic text, multi-media texts, hypertexts)."  
In this statement she also addressed the idea that electronic writing is "more than writing." To -elaborate, she included a quote
from her University of Illinois colleague Walt Huntsman: 

</p>

<p><blockquote>
Writing (no matter how it was done in any era) has always been more than the mere inscription of words upon the page. There are still the questions of audience and intent, questions which must be considered not only with regard to textual elements but also with regard to non-textual elements (pictures, graphics, etc.)  
</blockquote></p>

<p>
With a quote from Sigfried Gold, she also attempted to reassure those for whom the emergence of electronic writing 
represented the end of books, papers, and the standards associated with these: "I'm not sure what the writing was that 
we might have lost. I think the danger is not that we'll lose anything in writing on computers but that we'll gain too much 
and that that gain will lay the groundwork for much more profound and material losses later." 
What electronic writing has caused us to gain and lose—and the ways it has shaped our understanding of 
the very definition of writing-has been a topic of investigation and discussion in the (sub)field since <i>The History Book</i>. 
</p>

<p>
The early days of computers and writing were focused on experimenting with word processing, networked and computer-supported classrooms, 
and newly developed writing software of the one-stop-shop variety like WANDAH (Writer AND Author's Helper). Beyond the hard- and software-oriented 
work of computers and writing, we see the teacher-scholars of the (sub)field in the late 1990s rethinking and reconceptualizing 
the building blocks and key concepts of writing studies through the lens of the "electronic" first and later the "digital."

It is not so much that computers and writing's definition of <i>writing</i> has changed since its inception; 
it is that the technologies with which we write and compose have changed to become increasingly widespread, 
accessible, user-friendly, social, participatory, and interactive-and we write in different ways with these new technologies. 
Concomitantly, the job of defining <i>writing</i> has become more complex. For some teacher-scholars, the term <i>composition</i> has 
become more relevant than <i>writing</i> as visual and auditory components of texts have become more common. 
In her 1998 Computers and Writing Conference Town Hall Meeting "Position Statement," Cynthia L. Selfe 
pointed to three examples of this "expanded notion of both composition and text":  Geoffrey Sirc's work on the World Wide Web 
as influenced by "Happenings" artist Marcel Duchamp; Anne Wysocki's assignments for the creation of multimedia texts; 
and the more general existence of student built "personal homepages." As a (sub)field, we have typically embraced Selfe's perspective, 
taking a more capacious definition of writing than other areas of writing studies. 
We have experimented with and pushed the boundaries of multimodal and multimedia composing. 
Indeed, with <i>Kairos</i> we were the first (sub)field to have an online peer-reviewed journal for digitally born webtexts.
