An expanded understanding of "literacy" and what it meant for teaching was also a big part of the early 2000s scholarship. 
In his 2001 <i>Computers and Composition</i> article "Thinking Out of the Pro-Verbal Box," 
Sean D. Williams took up the task of rethinking what being literate means.  
Williams analyzed three of the most prominent journals in writing studies and argued that the field had 
perpetuated a "verbal bias" and risked ignoring the important work of visual rhetoric:

</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
To be literate in the twenty-first century means possessing the skills necessary to effectively 
construct and comfortably navigate multiplicity, to manipulate and critique information, representations, knowledge, 
and arguments in multiple media from a wide range of sources, and to use multiple expressive technologies including 
those offered by print, visual, and digital tools. (p. 22)

</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Here we see that while writing remained a central concern for computers and writing, 
the emphasis on print alone was being challenged in multiple ways. Williams was an early voice advocating for 
increased attention to visual modes and multimedia technologies. Anne Wysocki's early work (e.g., 1998, 2001) 
made a similar case and argued that too often we create and perpetuate false binaries between visual and verbal, 
between design and information, between word and image. Words, Wysocki told us, are "always visual elements" and "most often material" (p. 232). 
She affirmed that these artificial dichotomies do not get at â€œhow strategies of visual composition contribute to the relationships 
we develop with what we offer each other on the screen" (p. 232). Wysocki is notable in this context for how the form of 
her scholarship sought to mirror its content, perhaps most notably in her 2002 <i>Kairos</i> webtext "A Bookling Monument."

This attention to visual forms of communication and visual rhetoric led some teacher-scholars to support an expanded notion of literacy. 
Wysocki, together with Johndan Johnson-Eilola (1999) in their chapter in <i>Hawisher and Selfe's Passions, Pedagogies, and 21st-Century Technologies</i>, 
explicitly engaged the question of the consequences of such an expansion. In particular, they expressed concern at extending literacy 
to designate what students need to achieve with new technologies (and with non-verbal modes) because doing so reproduces a problematic 
(and for them untrue) notion of literacy: literacy skills are basic, neutral, contextless, and a panacea for the problems of the poor and oppressed 
(pp. 352-355). Wysocki and Johnson-Eilola expressed fear that such an extension of literacy widens the set of skills against 
which people are measured to be "literate" and, in doing so, increases the gap between the literate and illiterate, 
positioning oppressed, poor, or marginalized people as at fault if they do not achieve these skills (pp. 355, 360). 
At the same time, Wysocki and Johnson-Eilola noted opportunities for a new understanding of literacy made possible by new networked technologies. 
In particular, they proposed that online venues where intertextuality is spatially realized through actual movement from text to text,
along with "the ability to move in the new-technology spaces of information," enabled composers to make 
"instantaneous connections between informational objects that allow us to see them all at once," 
resulting in a view of the self that helps composers play a more active part in constructing themselves (pp. 363, 365-366). 
This tension between concern at overextending the reach of literacy and recognizing opportunities for new extensions of literacy 
characterized much of the scholarship of the late 1990s and 2000s.

In the early 2000s, focus on how to describe texts incorporating still image, video, sound, and/or animation, whether in print or digital form, intensified. 
To describe such writing, the New London Group (Cope & Kalantzis, 2000) used the term <i>multimodal</i>, affirming that multimodal literacies 
change with changing technologies (p. 6). New London Group member Gunther Kress's discussions of multimodality (Kress, 2003, 2005; Kress & Van Leeuwen, 1996, 2001)
were particularly influential in the computers and writing community, with Hawisher and Selfe focusing a 2005 special issue of <i>Computers and Composition</i> 
on his work. In their 2001 special issue of <i>Enculturation</i> on visual rhetoric , David Blakesley and Collin Brooke affirmed, 
"As students and teachers adapt to these new technologies and venues for reading and writing, it will be important to understand 
the ways that words and images function rhetorically and together in the various forms of media and literature that grab our attention 
and so delicately direct the intention." They, along with the contributing authors to their special issue, stressed that the 
visual cannot be understood in the same way as the verbal.

</p>

<p>
Contributors to Nancy Allen's edited volume <i>Working with Words and Images: New Steps in an Old Dance</i> (2002) agreed that the visual 
cannot be understood only through a verbal lens. They likewise argued that using words and images effectively together, 
as they saw media of the time to demand, requires a better understanding of how words and images work and relate. 
In her introduction to the volume, Allen herself called for approaching words and images 
"as collaborative means for understanding our world," not positioning them as "in a perpetual debate" or as opposing forces (pp., 10, 3). 
The collection offered perspectives from professional writing in particular. For instance, James Kalmbach's (2002) 
chapter contended that because we have not sufficiently studied the process by which words become images-that is, 
how they move from being transparent to being opaque-we lack understanding of the process 
by which writers come to see and use words as not transparent (e.g., use typographic emphasis) 
and, thus, incorrectly propagate what he called the "ransom note fallacy," the belief that novice 
writers clutter texts with multiple different fonts, type sizes, and formatting. 
Kalmbach contended that  novice writers, in fact, use almost no formatting at all (pp. 43-47). 
Ronald Fortune (2002) summarized a view espoused by many contributors to the collection: 
"writing instructors do not already possess and therefore must develop the knowledge about visual communication and its relationship to verbal communication" 
that teaching writing requires (p. 102). 
<p/>

<p>
Two other edited collections published in 2002 echoed similar ideas about the role of the visual within expanded notions of literacy. 
Contributors to Kristie S. Fleckenstein, Linda T. Calendrillo, and Demetrice A. Worley's edited volume <i>Language and Image in the Reading-Writing Classroom: 
Teaching Vision</i> affirmed that reading and writing instruction must address  the connection between words and images, 
particularly in and with new technologies. Similarly, contributors to Ilana Snyder's edited volume <i>Silicon Literacies: 
Communication, Innovation and Education in the Electronic Age</i> called for a broader, multimodal understanding of writing, 
semiotic systems, literacy, and communication in general. In her opening chapter, Snyder (2002) asserted, 
"reading and writing, considered traditionally as print-based and logocentric, are only part of what people have to learn to be literate. . . . 
In a electronically mediated world, being literate has to do with understanding how the different modalities are combined in complex ways to create meaning" 
(p. 3). In this way, she echoed Williams' call (2001) for broadening the definition of literacy.
