In the mid-90s and into the 2000s, hypertext became central to how the (sub)field thought about the the affordances of 
electronic writing in contrast to traditional, alphabetic text. Scholars, tracing their work as far back as the Alexandria library and Jorge Luis Borges, 
noted that nonlinear, multiform texts predate hypertext; however, they still marveled at hypertext's postmodern possibilities, 
as well as its potential contributions to progressive pedagogies. In 1995, Michael Joyce, in <i>Of Two Minds: Hypertext Pedagogy, and Poetics</i>, 
argued that with hypertext, traditional notions of text were subverted and reading became enacted design, embodied "action rather than a thing" (p. 11). 
He postulated that hypertext blurred the distinction between readers and writers (p. 19), claiming, "readers' choices constitute 
the current state of the hypertext and, in effect, its form" (p. 21), and advanced two uses of hypertext. 
The first was exploratory, a delivery or presentation technology allowing people to transform and represent existing information to meet their needs (p. 41). 
The second was constructive, an invention tool allowing people to create information to meet their needs, requiring 
"visual representations of the knowledge they develop" (p. 42). For Joyce, the former came from the latter (p. 44). 
He professed hypertext to be so exciting because basic writers could use hypertext 
"to empower themselves in transforming knowledge to their own ends" (p. 50) and because, for him, hypertext reflected how the mind works (pp. 56-57). 
Though these empowering ends were arguably never realized, this blurring of the roles of reader and 
writer would be taken up again in the (sub)field's discussions of Web 2.0/the Semantic Web. 
 
</p>

<p>
Two years later, in 1997, George Landow advanced similar ideas, though from a more theoretical perspective, 
signaling the (sub)field's gesture to theorize hypertext. Through a study of popular hypertext systems of the time (e.g., Storyspace, Intermedia), 
he argued that "[a]n experience of reading hypertext or reading with hypertext greatly clarifies many of the most significant ideas of critical theory," 
particularly those associated with Foucault and Barthes, where "ideas of center, margin, hierarchy, and linearity" are replaced with ideas 
of "multilinearity, nodes, links, and networks" (2). Like Joyce, he expressed excitement at the possibility of hypertext to lead to an 
"increasing democratization or dissemination of power" (277), a desired goal for much of the (sub)field's work in studying changing 
possibilities for and forms of writing.

</p>

<p>
 
Excitement about such possibilities disputably reached a peak with Joyce's and Landow's work, however, as the (sub)field came to realize hypertext's limitations. 
Johndan Johnson-Eilola's work arguably signaled the beginning of the fall of the (sub)field's focus on-or at least hope in the revolutionary 
possibilities of-hypertext. In  <i>Nostalgic Angels: Rearticulating Hypertext Writing</i>, Johndan Johnson-Eilola (1997), through a study of hypertext, 
argued that the (sub)field must "rearticulate" its definition of writing-that is, redraw its borders to become more interdisciplinary and less hierarchical, 
to prevent marginalization as a discipline, and "to gain cultural relevancy" (p. 6). In particular, he claimed that most views of hypertext were, 
at the time of his writing, nostalgic: they represented what we had hoped would develop from print technology. 
In other words, they imagined the future from an imagined technological past (p. 176). He warned against the potential downfalls of hypertext 
as a technology, particularly that it could seem like an innovative, progressive tool but that it ultimately upholds Post-Fordist logics toward 
increased technical efficiency. Johnson-Eilola affirmed that hypertext "frequently enacts functional literacy (how to read) 
and cultural literacy (what to read) but normally falls short of critical literacy (social critique)"; 
he asked for the latter to be engaged more directly in both scholarship and pedagogy, for reading and writing to be more overtly political, 
considering their conditions of production, consumption, and distribution (pp. 239, 241). In making this call, then, 
he concomitantly called for a change in the subject (or at least the framing) of the (sub)field's scholarship. 
He joined with Amy C. Kimme-Hea in 2003 to reinforce the limits and problems of previous claims regarding hypertext. 
Together they identified three tropes in this previous scholarship, "hypertext as kinship, hypertext as battlefield, and hypertext as rhizome" (p. 415), 
concluding that "[t]he best hypertext still has to offer us is its complexity and openness" (p. 423), as 
"a heuristic for thinking through our relationships to technology, literacy, and one another" (p. 420).
</p>

<p>
While interest in hypertext in the writing classroom may have waned, the turn of the 21st century brought continued attention to what counts as "writing." 
Alan Rea and Doug White (1999) treated multimedia forms-fonts, colors, images, sounds, etc.-as "new forms of writing" and 
made the case that <i>not</i> teaching students this "'new' writing style" leaves them ill-prepared to effectively communicate. 
The idea that writing for the web is a central communication tool-a "viable technology of literacy," as Rea and White described it (p. 423)-meant 
that digital composing needed to be considered the province of writing instructors . A striking absence in this article, however, 
is the lack of debate over HTML as a form of writing. Rea and White seemed to take it as natural that coding is a form of writing. 
They did show  awareness, however, that not everyone embraces their definitions of writing and warned, 
"Instructors should be aware that asking students to write Web pages is asking them to go against much of their academic training" (p. 422). 
This debate over the role of coding in the writing classroom and its treatment as writing has persisted through the 2010s as teacher-scholars, 
such as Kristin L. Arola (2010) and Karl Stolley (2012), explored and advocated for the value of coding as a means to have agency over 
web authoring programs and social media with preformatted templates.  

</p>

<p>
Along with questions of what writing looks like and what "counts" as writing, scholarship in major journals at the turn of the century 
increasingly asked questions about pedagogical practices and the efficacy of these emergent practices. 
For example, web-based portfolios, or "eportfolios," emerged as an important teaching tool and object of analysis , both for students and teachers. 
In  "Developing a University-Wide Electronic Portfolio System for Teacher Education," Laurie Mullen, William I. Bauer, and W. Webster Newbold (2001) 
studied the philosophical, logistical, and infrastructural considerations of eportfolios for pre-service teachers. 
They primarily focused on eportfolios as a tool of assessment designed to meet the needs of "the learning and competency objectives of the 
teacher education program," paying less attention to potential metacognitive or self-reflective benefits for writers.  
Eportfolios as a technology will be discussed further  in chapter two.
