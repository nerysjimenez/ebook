Distance education was also gaining traction at the turn of the millennium, which raised issues regarding 
how to conduct peer feedback, assess online writing, and clarify instruction. While the first article to address 
online distance education appeared in <i>Computers and Composition</i> in 1994, the journal published a themed issue on the topic 
in 2001 with twelve articles dedicated to the topic.  Patricia Webb Peterson’s article addressed two challenges or "blocks to learning" 
when it comes to online writing instruction:  1) students not getting enough written feedback or assessment and/or not understanding 
the tone of the feedback/assessment and 2) students not understanding the assignment (p. 367).  
The issue as a whole attempted to overcome looking at the pros and cons of online distance education in dichotomous terms 
and rather sought to pay attention the presence of this form of education in our field.  As Stuart Blythe pointed out, it 
is not going away whether or not we seek to ignore it. We are better off, as Peterson argues, playing a role in how decisions about 
online learning get made otherwise by corporate forces "rather than by academic standards" (p. 361). Terry Tannacito (2001) in her <i>Kairos</i> article, 
"Teaching Professional Writing Online with Electronic Peer Response," was one of the defenders of online learning as a pedagogical practice that has 
"great potential to improve writing"-especially in the form of online peer response.  In chapter two we will address the specific technologies 
that made distance education possible in greater detail.

<p>
In the mid-to-late 2000s, the (sub)field continued to expand its definition of writing. 
Jim Porter (2003) chronicled shifts felt by and engaged with in the (sub)field as a whole with his "Why Technology Matters to Writing: A Cyberwriter's Tale" 
in <i>Computers and Composition</i>. In this article, Porter shared a personal narrative of his own "development as a writer over time-from 
handwriting to typewriting to cyberwriting" (p. 375) to showcase the different types of writing (and technologies used to produce them) 
the (sub)field has studied.

</p>

<p>
Johndan Johnson-Eilola (2005) cast the work of computers and writing even more widely, as in symbols, not just writing. 
In <i>Datacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work</i>, he advanced that "symbols are now a class of material objects, conceptual objects, 
with market value, social force, and dimension," offering the material and the symbolic as indistinguishable in the world, which, 
for him, meant new patterns of working and living (p. 4). To support this argument, he studied the "datacloud," which he defined as 
"a shifting and only slightly contingently structured information space" that information workers, like computers and writing professionals, inhabit (p. 4). 
In the datacloud, Johnson-Eilola argued, traditional notions of agency, production, and creativity were challenged. 
He professed that agency was no longer found in linear, ordered models of interaction, but rather in assembling bits and pieces from multiple channels (pp. 9-10). 
As a result, Johnson-Eilola affirmed, "[i]n a postmodernist era, creativity is about movement, connection, and selection rather 
than a mythical genius ability to pull inspiration from within" (p. 110) and "[c]reativity is no longer the production of original texts, 
but the ability to gather, filter, rearrange, and construct new texts-symbolic-analytic work, articulations" (p. 134). 
He argued "traditional originality" was of decreasing value; rather, rearranging, abstracting, connecting, and transforming information 
was of increasing merit-and characteristic of what, following Robert Reich, he called symbolic-analytic work, which he saw as the work of not 
only the (sub)field but also larger society (p. 30). In this way, he challenged a valuation-or even the possibility-of writing as unique and solely 
owned-a position he further expounded upon in his <i>Computers and Composition</i> article "Plagiarism, Originality, Assemblage" with Stuart Selber (2007).

</p>

<p>
Johnson-Eilola was not the only one to recognize the overlap between the work of computers and writing and larger society, 
addressing a need to define multimodality in connection to industry-specific terminology, <i>multimedia</i>. Claire Lauer, in her 2009 <i>Computers and Composition</i> 
article "Contending with Terms: 'Multimodal' and 'Multimedia' in the Academic and Public Spheres," analyzed the use of the terms 
<i>multimodal</i> and <i>multimedia</i> in academic and industry publications. She concluded that <i>multimodal</i> was the term preferred 
by computers and writing practitioners (and writing studies more generally), while multimedia was the term preferred by 
the non-academic public and industry. Important for our purposes in this history is that Lauer explicitly connected the use of these 
terms directly to changing technologies:

</p>

<p><blockquote>
Both multimedia and multimodal arose in response to the technological advancement that was occurring-in the late 60's and early 90's for multimedia 
and late 90's for multimodal-but while multimedia emerged out of industry, multimodal arose out of the academic scholarship of the New London Group. 
As a result, the use of multimedia in industry remains dominant, while the use of multimodal within composition scholarship has grown. (p. 237)
</blockquote></p>

<p>
Lauer traced these preferences in terminology to what is valued and emphasized in these different contexts: 
writing studies teacher-scholars value process while industry values product. She suggested, therefore, that discussions of writing for 
non-academic audiences would do well to use the term <i>multimedia</i>, though <i>multimodal</i> is ultimately the more theoretically accurate term (pp. 225, 238).

</p>

<p>
In working to describe such multimodal productions, computers and writing teacher-scholars have turned to the term design. 
In his 2014 CCC article "What Can Design Thinking Offer Writing Studies?", James P. Purdy identified one of the five reasons writing studies 
teacher-scholars used the term design as to "conceptualize composing as multimodal" (p. 615). 
Purdy traced the use of the word design in writing studies scholarship in several prominent writing studies journals 
<i>(College Composition and Communication, College English, Computers and Composition, Pedagogy, and Research in the Teaching of English)</i> 
from their inception to the end of September 2011. He found that Computers and Composition published the most articles with design in the title (p. 614). 
Carrie S. Leverenz's 2014 <i>Computers and Composition</i> article "Design Thinking and the Wicked Problem of Teaching Writing" 
offered an example of computers and writing’s engagement with <i>design</i>. Like Purdy, she argued for computers and writing 
teacher-scholars to apply design thinking, an approach to solving "wicked" design problems that is used in architecture, 
art and design, business, and engineering, to teaching writing, particularly as a way to bridge extracurricular and in-school 
writing and to prepare students to produce multimodal texts (p. 2). Both likewise advocated collaborative projects and 
experimentation as means to enact design thinking (Leverenz, 2014, pp. 8-9; Purdy, 2014, pp. 629-631)-pedagogical ideas that 
have resonated with computers and writing teacher-scholars since <i>The History Book</i>.   
</p>

<p>
Purdy's (2014)  analysis suggested that <i>design</i> has been a particularly useful term "for technology-related work in the field" (p. 614) 
and invocation of the term <i>design</i> reflected writing studies' increased attention to composing modalities and technologies. 
This finding perhaps illustrates the increasing centrality of concerns of the (sub)field of computers and writing to the field of 
writing studies at large in the late 2000s and early 2010s. That is, it was not only computers and writing specialists but 
writing studies teacher-scholars more broadly who were grappling with how to describe, account for, 
and theorize multimodal and multimedia texts. While scholars such as Jason Palmieri (2012) have argued such 
concerns are not new to the discipline-which is likewise emphasized by invocation of <i>design</i> 
in mainstream scholarship in the field for decades (e.g., George, 2002; Kostelnick, 1989; Marback, 2009)-their 
visibility in the larger scholarship arguably is. Such gestures point to the (sub)field's continued interest 
in finding ways to describe multimodal texts-and the usefulness of this work for the larger discipline.

<i>Kairos</i> webtexts like Catherine DeLuca's "'Can we block these political thingys? I just want to get f*cking recipes:' 
Women, Rhetoric, and Politics on Pinterest" (2015) and William I. Wolff's  "Baby, We Were Born to Tweet: Springsteen Fans, 
the Writing Practices of <i>In Situ</i> Tweeting, and the Research Possibilities for Twitter" (2015) illustrated/enacted this attention 
to design both by arguing for the legitimacy of forms of writing in new digital spaces and by using webtext design to support these arguments. 
DeLuca (2015), for instance, constructed a webtext mirroring the Pinterest interface to argue that 
"the mundane rhetorical and civic engagements that occur on Pinterest are significant and representative of the public rhetorics that shape 
the everyday composing practices and experiences of digital citizens" ("Politics") and that "Pinterest is a space in which 
cyberfeminism can flourish in multiple forms" ("Cyberfeminism"). In order to navigate DeLuca's webtext, readers must experience the space of Pinterest. 

</p>

<p>

Similarly, Wolff (2015) designed a webtext interface to argue for the rhetorical work and value of 
"the composing practices of members of the Springsteen community at or tweeting about one particular concert" ("Fans"). 
The structure of the webtext, which forestalls providing a thesis until the <a href ="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/19.3/topoi/wolff/results.html">conclusion</a> in favor of detailed discussion of his 
tweet coding process, endeavored to illustrate Wolff's position that "<a href ="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/19.3/topoi/wolff/methodology.html#methods" >[g]rounded theory studies</a> have the potential to continue 
to transform how scholars, teachers, students, and the general public understand the community-wide importance of composing, 
even <i>especially</i> in 140-character bursts" ("Conclusions"). Just as grounded theory asks researchers to wait to draw conclusions 
until after experiencing the data, Wolff's webtext asked readers to wait for his thesis until they experienced his data. 
DeLuca (2015) and Wolff (2015) help readers see (quite literally) the ways in which writing in Pinterest and Twitter makes meaning.

</p>

<p>
Taken together, this scholarship reveals that, since <i>The History Book</i>, 
the (sub)field's ongoing work on defining writing reflects conversations regarding both whether writing should (or can) 
be limited to the verbal or include other modalities (still image, video, animation), as well as how best to account for 
what writing does (and can do) in digital spaces and forms. It also shows the rise and fall of belief in hypertext 
as a form of writing to realize the democratic and feminist goals of the (sub)field. More broadly, the trajectory of the 
(sub)field's publications shows adoption of a capacious definition of writing, including hypertext, videos, tweets, 
and other new forms as "legitimate" and rhetorical, even if excitement about the revolutionary possibilities 
of those new forms of writing has grown more cautious. Alongside its shift from a focus on "electronic" writing to "digital" and "multimodal" writing, 
the field has arguably also come to profess that new kinds of writing cannot magically solve old problems (e.g., of inequality, access). 
In a sense, then, as the (sub)field has included more varied forms of writing in its research and teaching, it has also taken a more critical 
stance toward these forms of writing, seeking to carefully describe and analyze rather than just enthusiastically adopt, 
sometimes creating new terms (e.g., <i>cyberwriter</i>) when language did not already exist and sometimes borrowing and adapting language 
from other disciplines (e.g., <i>design</i>). In turn, the (sub)field has offered more complex notions of authorship, textual ownership, 
and audience, recognizing ways in which multimodal, multimedia, and digital forms of writing blur the distinction between author 
and audience as well as who can own what regarding a text.
