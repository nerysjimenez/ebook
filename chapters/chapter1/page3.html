Opportunities for physically disperse audiences to be users and creators likewise compelled reconsiderations of 
our understanding of and approaches to collaborative writing. A 1999 collaboratively written essay on "textuality, collaboration, and the new essay," 
by Myka Vielstimmig (the combined "pen" name for Michael Spooner and Kathleen Blake Yancey) suggested a clear connection between online 
spaces and collaborative writing:

</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
The emerging e-journals in composition and rhetoric, the experiments in form within established print journals, 
even stand-alone websites offer work in progress-it seems a majority of these efforts conceive of the online publication 
as a place of interaction. The texts usually have multiple authors, they're hyperlinked to other sites, they invite readers to contribute, and so on.  
Their tacit theory seems to be that the ethos of the net is a collaborative one. (p. 91)  

</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The author(s) stressed that emerging forms of collaborative writing are not simple to compose.  
Even those of us who frequently engage in collaborative work, as we did in writing this history, 
find it to be "like taking on a new identity; issues you hadn't foreseen arise. It's easier not to sail to the new land" (p. 95). 
Regardless of whether it is "easier not to sail the new land," Vielstimmig argued it is irresponsible not to do so. 
Andrea Lunsford and Susan West (1996) reinforced this idea when they wrote:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
The ubiquitous media coverage of the complex issues swirling around the question of who owns language-for that is what this debate is finally 
about-demands a response from our profession, as those most concerned with shaping and perpetuating notions about what it means to 
read, write, and speak. In particular, compositionists have a compelling interest in how laws governing ownership of 
language should be adjusted (if at all) to accommodate both new technologies and postmodern challenges to established ideas about "authorship." (p. 383)
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
These challenges to our conception of authorship became central questions of the 1990s and 2000s: 
Who owns hypertext writing and other forms of online, public discourse that are often the result of collaboration 
and/or easier-than-ever "borrowing"? In what ways do notions of intellectual property, and copyright more specifically, 
intersect with this work? In a collaboratively written webtext, Andrea Lunsford, Rebecca Rickly, Michael Salvo, 
and Susan West took on precisely these kinds of concerns. Their frequently cited article from <i>Kairos</i>'s 
premiere issue in 1996 called into question the notion of the singular author as sole proprietor of a text. 
The authors claim that all texts are social is made more visible and explicit by electronic writing in general and hypertext in particular: 
"To be more specific, hypertext makes the always implicit intertextuality of any scholarly discourse explicit. 
To me, this explicitness seems also valuable because, to put it bluntly, it 'outs' academic discourse, demonstrating it to be deeply collaborative, 
deeply multivoiced" (Lunsford et al.). While it might not be accurate to characterize Lunsford's description of hypertext as utopian, 
she did express high hopes for the changes it might help bring about in how we view scholarly discourse and understand textual ownership and authorship.   
</p>

<p>
Alongside questions of authorship, concerns about plagiarism were also looked at anew in the 1990s. 
In his 1998 edited collection, <i>Cyberreader</i>, Victor Vitanza addressed "techno-culture," 
with his inclusion of a controversial piece by the Critical Art Ensemble (CAE), 
"a group of unnamed performance thinkers" (p. 339) who, for some teacher-scholars seemed to encourage plagiarism.  
Vitanza recounted receiving criticism from instructors who thought the piece should not have been 
included in the collection because it could encourage students to plagiarize. 
The CAE described techno-culture as "recombinant" and argued that plagiarism is "productive," even "necessary" :
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
Ideas improve.  The meaning of words participates in the improvement.  Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it.  
It embraces an author's phrase, makes use of his expressions, erases a false idea, and replaces it with the right idea. (pp. 339-340)
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
This defense of techno-culture's recombining and remixing of materials was the cyberactivist version of 
"we stand on the shoulders of giants" and represented a radical rethinking of the way some teacher-scholars in 
writing studies had previously thought about plagiarism as something to be avoided and persecuted. 
It also paved the way for the scholarship on "patchwriting" and intellectual property that emerged 
at this time (e.g., Howard, 1999, 2000; Logie, 1998; Walker 1998), as "techno-culture's" influence began to influence thinking in the parent field.
It is perhaps no accident, then, that the CCCC Intellectual Property Caucus has historically been comprised primarily of computers and writing teacher-scholars.   
</p>

<p>
In his <i>Kairos</i> webtext "Hypertext in the Computer-Facilitated Classroom," Douglas Eyman (1996) illustrated this more nuanced 
and complex approach to source use and collaboration by addressing  the social aspect of web-based writing.  
He showed ways in which  the interactive qualities of hypertext are dialogic and argued that hypertext  creation 
by students called to mind Bakhtinian notions of heteroglossia and appropriation. Eyman also made the case for student construction 
of hypertext as a means of illuminating the concept of audience:  

</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
If the aim of composition is written communication, then the presence of a "real" audience (Walter Ong notwithstanding) is a boon 
to the writing teacher--students who receive feedback on their work from people who do not even go to their school 
(indeed may not even reside in the same country as they do), tend to work harder to convey their ideas clearly. 
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
This attention to production as well as consumption forecasted a theme that emerged with even greater force in the 2000s with discussion of Web 2.0.
